              My name is Mia Lambrechts and reFlair Ideas and Interiors is my business and passion.

              I have been blessed and fortunate to turn my passion for beautiful interiors into a
              profession, as I believe that being able to find serenity and comfort in one's home is
              a crucial factor in quality of life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg">
              I joined Hanlie Claasen Interiors in 2017 after being a stay-at-home mom to my two
              daughters, and I will be ever grateful for this opportunity, as well as for Hanlie's
              wealth of knowledge and experience that she has shared with me during this time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 sm:text-lg">
              I believe we live in an environment where most consumers are resourceful and
              well-informed (albeit overwhelmed!) thanks to social media and technology. I see my
              purpose as listening to a clientâ€™s ideas and then bringing to the table perspective
              and context, as well as a holistic view, by applying sound design principles. True to
              its name, by reFlair-ing, my aim is to offer guidance and services on the subject of
              flair - and I would like to once again add flair to your home.
